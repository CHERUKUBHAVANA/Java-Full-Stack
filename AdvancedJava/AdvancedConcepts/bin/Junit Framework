Unit Testing Framework:
-Prepare (setup a test environment, write test methods,...).
-Provide testing input.
-Run the test.
-Provide expected output.
-Perform assertion (verify the result).
-Report test results (alert developer if test is failed or passed).

All these steps are automatically performed by JUnit, given an input and expected output.
API used for JUnit5 is Jupiter API, It consists of all methods required for assertion. Used to write the tests.
JUnit5 doesn't provide backward compatibility.
Vintage API - to provide backward compatibility.
Extension - enhances the capability of JUnit5. Can use the platform of JUnit5 without the need of using Jupiter API.
All the IDEs are integrated with this platform.

Maven provides a specific structure to write tests in JUnit5.
File - New - Other - Maven Project - GroupId (similar to package name) and Artifact ID - Finish
