Download Git from internet.
Check the version in cmd using -> git --version
Configure your git -> git config --global user.name "bhavana"
			git config --global user.email "bhavanabhavana1013@gmail.com"
Check your git credentials -> git config --global --list

Make a folder for your project. (Working directory)
-> git init (local repo) , this will create a local repo with default main branch named "master"
(OR) -> git init -b main , to change the name of local repo from "master" to "main"

Create files in your folder of the project.
Before committing the changes (adding files, editing files,...), add those files to the staging area, so that git can access and keep track of those.

Adding to staging area (in local repo i.e, git init):
-> git add filename
-> git add .    (to add all the untracked files)

Committing the changes (from staging area):
-> git commit -m "commit message"

To display all commits:
-> git log

From working directory to commit directly (without moving to staging area):
-> git commit -a -m "commit msg"

To show differences between current status and previous commit:
-> git diff (before staging)
-> git diff --staged (after staging)

To remove a file from git:
-> git rm -cached filename

git switch branchname (To switch from one branch to another)
git push origin branchname (To put new branch also on github server)
git branch -d branchname (To delete an existing branch)
git pull origin branchname (Before merging)
