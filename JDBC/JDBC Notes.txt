7 steps in connecting Java Application to the database:

1. Import the package (java.sql.*)
2. Load and Register the Driver
	Download mysql-Connector .jar file
	Load it in the project.
	For MySql driver : com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
	To register, Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")
3. Establish the Connection
	Instantiate Connection interface.
4. Create the Statement
	Statement is of 3 types-
		Statement: Execute a query.
		Prepared Statement: Predefined query execution with new inputs.
		Callable Statement: Execute Procedural Language in SQL, i.e, for stored procedures.
5. Excecute the query
6. Process the results
7. Close the Statement object and then the Connection object.


DQL (select query) : executeQuery()
DML : executeUpdate()
DDL : execut()

Using Statement - executeUpdate(query)
PreparedStatement - when query is fixed and values are dynamic; executeUpdate()

Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver") -> When class is loaded, static block gets executed. Here, the static block of Driver class contains code for registering the driver.
i.e,
static
{
	DriverManager.registerDriver(new Driver());
}
